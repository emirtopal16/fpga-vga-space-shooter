# fpga-vga-space-shooter
This project is a digital hardware implementation of an isometric shooter game, developed using Verilog HDL on an FPGA platform. The system integrates a custom VGA interface to render a 640x480 resolution game field, displaying the player ship and enemies in real-time. The game logic includes a central spaceship that rotates to defend against enemies spawning from 16 different radial trajectories. The design features player-controlled rotation and distinct firing modes—wide spray for lower damage and narrow spray for higher damage—managed through hardware inputs on the FPGA board. Logic synthesis was utilized to handle collision detection and game-over conditions dynamically.
